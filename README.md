# TheSandwichDatabase
Simple Spring and Angular Database with front and backend.

Upon Downloading you need to do npm install for angular and install all needed files off of https://angular.io/guide/setup-local 
After angular us set up you need to run the server using ng serve --open in the directory of 'rileysandwiches'.
The Springboot is was ran on netbeans 15 in my case and is ran by just running the application run file.
